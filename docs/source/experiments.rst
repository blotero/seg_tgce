Experimental setup
------------------

We established several experiments for training and benchmarking our models,
including the Oxford pet experiment and the histology images experiment.


Oxford III Pet
==============

Our first experiment was elaborated on the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset. 
This dataset contains 37 classes of pets, with around 200 images per class. 
The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set. 
The training set contains 3680 images, and the test set contains 3669 images. 
The images are of different sizes and aspect ratios. 
The dataset is available at the following link:

Crowd Seg Histopatological images
=================================

Our second experiment was elaborated on the CrowdSeg dataset, which consists of 
Triple Negative Breast Cancer images labeled by 20 medical students.

This dataset fairly represents the original intention of the project, which is to
provide a tool for pathologists to segment histopathological images.
