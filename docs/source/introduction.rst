Why image segmentation?
========================
In machine learning, image segmentation is a computational process for obtaining
a set of pixel-wise labels that identify the objects in an image. This process is
used in many applications, such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and image
editing. The goal of image segmentation is to divide an image into regions that
correspond to different objects or parts of objects.

What does multiple annotators mean?
====================================
In the context of image segmentation, multiple annotators refer to the situation where
more than one person is responsible for labeling the images. This is a common situation
in medical imaging, where the same image can be labeled by different experts. The goal of
Segmentation TCGE is to combine the labels of multiple annotators to obtain a more accurate
segmentation of the images.
